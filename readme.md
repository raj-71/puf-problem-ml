# XOR-PUF Security Analysis for Operational Technology (OT) Systems

## Introduction

This project focuses on enhancing cybersecurity in Operational Technology (OT) systems by analyzing and predicting XOR-based Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). By understanding XOR-PUF behavior, we aim to improve the security of OT systems against potential threats.

## Objectives

- **Develop SVM-based Solvers**: Create solvers from scratch to model XOR-PUF behavior.
- **Advanced Feature Mapping**: Implement techniques to capture XOR-PUF complexities.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Test the model with extensive datasets.
- **Cybersecurity Focus**: Enhance security in OT systems.

## Methodology
